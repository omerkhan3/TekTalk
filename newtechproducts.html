<tr> <td  class = "postcontent"> If you're like me, you may be weary of all the current mainstream phones on the market.  Phones from manufacturers like Samsung, Motorola, Apple, etc.  all come carrier locked, and loaded with bloatware that can seriously hurt performance.   Thankfully for us, a new market alternative has emerged.  Following the standards of its predecessor (the Nexus line),  the Google Pixel has emerged as a new titan in the smartphone industry. Branded and created by Google itself, the Pixel is a worthy adversary to the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7.  The Pixel comes in 2 models: the Pixel and the Pixel XL.  Google invested significant money in creating an impeccable camera, and the result is pictures that can rival any phone on the market including the iPhone 7 Plus.  If you're in the market for a great voice assistant, look no further.  Google Assistant is a new voice system that is clearly the leader in the market over Siri.  It provides the most natural experience in terms of speaking, and is incredibly useful for users.  All in all, if you're like me and want to ditch the mainstream phones with all the bloatware and carrier software, you'll pick up the Google Pixel. </td></tr>

<tr> <td class = "postcontent"> For the past year since its launch, Samsung has faced an absolute disaster with it's Samsung Galaxy Note 7.  The phone batteries were overheating, and had caused serious injuries by exploding.  Samsung had since had a customer return program with almost 93 percent already returned.  However, Samsung announced that the saga is officially over next week when a new update is being pushed that will not allow the phones to charge or function properly; prompting users to return them to their local retailer for a rebate or exchange.  This marks the end of a disastorous product launch for Samsung, but also raises an interesting question.  As Verizon has pointed out, rendering the phones useless could be dangerous for those traveling in the winter season if they don't have an alternate phone option.  Verizon has said it will not push the update for this reason, so it will be interesting to see how this plays out.  All in all, Samsung continues to struggle with the phone right until the end. </td></tr>
